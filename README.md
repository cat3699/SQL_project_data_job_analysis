# Introduction

This project is a follow-along from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA) to learn SQL. It dives into the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles but adaptable to other roles within the field of data analysis. The project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and identifies the optimal skills that combine high demand and high salary.

### The questions that I learned to answer through this tutorial are the following:

1. What are the top paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analyst ?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries ?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn ? 
# Tools used 

The tools that I used and learned by following this tutorial are the following:

- **SQL:** The backbone of the analysis, allowing me to query the database and derive useful insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** The text editor used for database management as well as executing queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing the SQL scripts and analysis I learned from this tutorial.

# Analysis

Each query of this project aimed to investigating which speficic aspects of the data analyist job market.
Here is how each question proposed was approached:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest paying roles, I filtered the data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying oportunities in the field.

````sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short ='Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
````

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles

````sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short ='Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10 
)

SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
       skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
````

## 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

````sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
````

## 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

````sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg)) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
````

## 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn

Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.

````sql
WITH skills_demand AS(
    SELECT 
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
    WHERE 
        job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True
    GROUP BY 
        skills_dim.skill_id
), top_paying_skills AS(
    SELECT 
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg)) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
    WHERE 
        job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True
    GROUP BY 
        skills_dim.skill_id
)


SELECT 
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN top_paying_skills on skills_demand.skill_id = top_paying_skills.skill_id
WHERE demand_count > 10
ORDER BY demand_count DESC, avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
